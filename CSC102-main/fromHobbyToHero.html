<h2 class = "subHeader-text">Welcome to the Real Skynet</h2>

<h4 class = "subHeader-text">Unamanned Systems (UxS) are the the wave of the future.  Most popular systems are Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAV) and Unmanned Ground Systems (UGV). 
These devices can operate with a pilot, through pre-programmed instructions, and have even been able to make seemingly completely autonomous deciscions.
 I have spent years working side by side with these UXS often giving my robots names like "Rick" and "Morty." We did have one robot that always seemed to be 
 subject to rapid disassembly and was once again shipped of to get repaired.  More recent developments have made the advent of the UAS more ubiquitous in our
 everyday lives.</h4>

 <h2 class = "subHeader-text">1) Types of Drones</h2>
 <h4 class = "subHeader-text">Consumer: Designed for recreational use, such as photography, videography, and racing.<br><br>
Commercial: Used in industries like agriculture, construction, and delivery services.<br><br>
Military: Utilized for surveillance reconnaissance, and combat operations.<br><br>
Industrial: Employed for inspections, monitoring, and emergency response.<br><br>
Racing: Designed specifically for drone racing competitions.</h4>
<br>
<h2 class = "subHeader-text">2) Basic Components of Drones</h2>
<h4 class = "subHeader-text">Airframe: The structure that holds all the components together. Can be made from an endless amount of materials like metal, plastic, carbon fiber, or even cardoard.<br><br>
Propulsion System: Includes motors, propellers, and batteries that provide lift.<br><br>
Flight Controller: The brain of the drone that stabilizes flight and process input from the pilot and onboard sensors.<br><br>
Sensors: Global Positioning System (GPS), gyroscopes, and cameras assist in the navigation and data collection. More advanced sensors can be found such as ultrasonic or Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).<br><br>
Communication System: Facilitates remote control and data transmission between the drone and operator.</h4>
<br>
<h2 class = "subHeader-text">3) Technology Behind Drones</h2><br>
<h4 class = "subHeader-text">GPS and Navigation: Most drones use GPS for precise navigation and positioning. This allows for autonomous flight and waypoint tracking.<br><br>
Computer Vision: Many drones are equiped with cameras and other advanced sensors that enable them to conduct obsticle avoidance, enhancing safety during flight.<br><br>
Maching Learning: Some drones use machine learning algorithms to analyze data collected during flights, improving overall performance in tasks.<br><br>
First Person View (FPV): Used primarily for racing and military applications, FPV allows the pilot to see from the drone's perspective.</h4><br><br>
<br>
<h2 class = "subHeader-text">4) Regulatory and Safety</h2><br>
<h4 class = "subHeader-text">Regulatory Bodies: Different countries have specific regulations. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) overseas all UAS operations.<br><br>
Registration: Most countries require drone registration for commercial and certain recreational uses, especially for drones over certain weights.<br><br>
Flight Restrictions: Drones must avoid restricted airspace, maintain a certain altitude, and operate within the pilots Line of Sight (LOS).<br><br>
Safety Guidlines: Operators should follow safety protocols to avoide accidents, respect the local laws and privacy of others.  Also, keep your fingers out of the propellers, it seems like they turn on, for like, no reason.</h4><br><br>

        One should have an equal number of takeoff and landings.  This one does not.
